    "Using `T0` and `T1` as above, create a trajectory that moves from `T0` to `T1` in 101 steps, but do so using Twists and the `mtraj` method. Plot the translational and rotational components of the trajectory and also create an animation. How does this trajectory differ from the one created using `SE3.interp`? Do you see any advantages or disadvantages of using twists?\n",
